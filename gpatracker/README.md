# CGPA CALCULATOR
# Author: Manal Mahmood - 6340044

## Project Description:
This is a project for my Web App Development class in Assumption University. It is a simple and easy to use web application to calculate your Cumulative GPA according to the subjects that you have chosen to study and the grade received in them to track your progress.

The UI is designed to be clean and userfriendly, using colors such as White, Blue, and Black, and furthermore utilizing Neuromorphism so that there is a modern white touch to it, while still being able to focus on the typography and main function of the app.

### Features:
* Add and Delete courses taken in a semester
* Select major between CS and IT
* Select grades for each course which holds its own value, (A holds 4.0.. etc)
* Add Semesters
* Shows Calculated GPA for different Semesters
* Shows Calculated CGPA for all semesters combined

### Techstack:
* Gatsby
* UseState and useEffect from REACT
* Bootstrap for styling
* Uuid for unique course id generation
* The data for the courses is stored in a JSON file cs-2021.json
